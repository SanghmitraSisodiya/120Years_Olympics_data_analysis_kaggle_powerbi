## About the Dataset
###Context

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Before uploading on Kaggle, this was scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. The R code was used to scrape and wrangle the data. 

## Objective 
To understand and analyse about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.

Acknowledgements
The Olympic data on www.sports-reference.com is the result of an incredible amount of research by a group of Olympic history enthusiasts and self-proclaimed 'statistorians'. Check out their blog for more information. All I did was consolidated their decades of work into a convenient format for data analysis.

## Some Important Insights - 
The first Event of the Olympics had no participation of female athletes. 
The female participation increased significantly in late 1950's and saw big increase in 1980's.
The participation rate of athletes keeps increasing in Winter games.
1916, 1940 & 1944 summer Olympic games and 1940 & 1944 winter Olympic games didn't happen.
World War was the reason for this.  
Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. 
Summer Games have more participations than Winter Games
Hpwever, the rate of participation of athletes in Summer Games have become stagnant recently.
